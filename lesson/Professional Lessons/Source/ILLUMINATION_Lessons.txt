# ILLUMINATION

## Laws of Illumination

1. The Illumination is directly proportional to the luminous intensity of the light source.
2. The Illumination varies inversely as the square of the distance from the source of light.
3. The illumination varies directly as the cosine of the angle between the normal to the surface and the direction of the incident light (**Lambert’s Law**).

### Formulas
* $E_p = \frac{I}{d^2} \cos\theta$
* $I = \frac{\Phi}{4\pi} \text{ (Candela)}$
* $E_p = \text{Lux}$

## METHOD OF COMPUTATION: POINT BY POINT

### Formulas
* $E_P = \frac{I}{d^2} \cos \theta$
* $E_P = \frac{Iz}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}$

### Maximum Illumination:
$h = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}s$

## Mean CANDLE POWER

* **Mean horizontal candle power (MHCP):** MHCP is defined as the mean of the candle power of source in all directions in **horizontal plane**.
* **Mean spherical candle power (MSCP):** MSCP is defined as the mean of the candle power of source in **all planes**.
* **Mean hemispherical candle power (MHSCP):** MHSCP is defined as the mean of the candle power of source in all directions above or **below the horizontal plane**.

### Formulas
* $MSCP = \frac{\text{lumens}}{4\pi}$
* **Reduction Factor (RF):** $RF = \frac{MSCP}{MHCP}$
* **Utilization Factor (UF):** $UF = \frac{\text{lumens in working plane}}{\text{lumens from source}}$

## Illumination Factors and Number of Lamps

### Utilization Factor
$UF = \frac{\text{lumens in working plane}}{\text{lumens from source}}$

### Maintenance Factor
$MF = \frac{\text{Illum. at normal working condition}}{\text{Illum. at clean condition}} = \frac{1}{\text{DepreciationFactor}}$

### Number of Lamps
$N = \frac{E \times A \times WF}{\phi \times UF \times MF} \rightarrow \phi_T = \phi \times UF \times MF$
