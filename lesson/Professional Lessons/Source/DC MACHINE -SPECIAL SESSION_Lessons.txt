# DC MACHINES

## Introduction
*   **DC Generator**: Converts mechanical power ($\omega T$) into DC electrical power ($EI$).
*   **DC Motor**: Converts DC electrical power into mechanical power.

## Main Constructional Features
*   **Magnetic frame or yoke**: The outer cylindrical part that provides mechanical protection to the inner parts of the machine.
*   **Pole core and pole shoes**: Support the field or exciting coils and spread out the magnetic flux over the armature periphery more uniformly.
*   **Field or exciting coils**: Enamelled copper wire is used for the construction of field or exciting coils.
*   **Armature core**: It is cylindrical in shape and keyed to the rotating shaft that houses the conductors in the slots.
*   **Armature winding**: The insulated conductors housed in the armature slots where conversion of power takes place.

## Commutator Action
*   **Generator Action**: Converts the AC induced in the armature conductors into unidirectional current in the external load circuit.
*   **Motor Action**: Converts the alternating torque into unidirectional (continuous) torque produced in the armature.
*   *Note*: Because of the positioning of the brushes, the measured voltage at the x-y terminals is uni-directional.

## EMF Equation (Generator)
$$E = \frac{p\phi NZ}{60a}$$

**Where:**
*   $p$ = number of poles
*   $\phi$ = flux/pole (Wb)
*   $Z$ = number of conductors = $\text{slots} \times \text{conductor/slot}$
*   $N$ = speed in rpm
*   $a$ = number of parallel paths
    *   $a = p \rightarrow$ lap winding
    *   $a = 2 \rightarrow$ wave winding

## Types of DC Generators
According to the method of excitation, D.C. generators are classified as follows:
1.  **Separately excited generators**: Field coils are energized from an independent external DC source.
    *   $E_g = V + I_aR_a + V_{brush}$
2.  **Self-excited generators**:
    *   **Shunt wound**
    *   **Series wound**
    *   **Compound wound**

## Generator Formulas

### Shunt Wound Generator
*   $I_{sh} = \frac{V}{R_{sh}}$
*   $I_a = I_{sh} + I$
*   $V = E_g - I_aR_a$
*   $\text{Power Developed} = E_g I_a$
*   $\text{Power Delivered} = IV$

### Series Wound Generator
*   $I_a = I_{se} = I$
*   $V = E_g - I(R_a + R_{se})$
*   $\text{Power Developed} = E_g I_a$
*   $\text{Power Delivered} = IV$

### Compound Wound Generators
*   **Short Shunt**:
    *   $I_{se} = I$
    *   $I_{sh} = \frac{V + I_{se}R_{se}}{R_{sh}}$
    *   $V = E_g - I_aR_a - I_{se}R_{se}$
*   **Long Shunt**:
    *   $I_{sh} = \frac{V}{R_{sh}}$
    *   $I_a = I_{se} = I + I_{sh}$
    *   $V = E_g - I_a(R_a + R_{se})$

## DC Motors

### EMF Equation
$$E_b = \frac{p\phi ZN}{60a}$$
(Where $E_b$ is the Back EMF)

### Torque Equation
*   **Developed Torque**: $T_a = k\phi I_a$
    *   $k = \frac{pZ}{2\pi a}$
*   **Shaft Torque**: $P_b = \frac{2\pi T_{sh} N}{60}$

### Speed and Torque Ratios
*   **Shunt Motor**:
    *   $\frac{E_{b2}}{E_{b1}} = \frac{N_2}{N_1}$
    *   $\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{I_{a2}}{I_{a1}}$
*   **Series Motor**:
    *   $\frac{E_{b2}}{E_{b1}} = \frac{N_2}{N_1} \left( \frac{I_{L2}}{I_{L1}} \right)$
    *   $\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{I_{L2}}{I_{L1}} \right)^2$
