# HARMONIC MOTION & SOUND WAVES

## Types of Waves
*   **Transverse:** motion of particle is perpendicular to the direction of wave.
*   **Longitudinal:** motion of particle is parallel to the direction of wave.

**Wave Equations:**
*   $v = f\lambda$
*   $v = 0.6T_c + 331 \text{ m/s}$
*   $v = 343 \text{ m/s at 20°C}$

## Sound Loudness
*   **Amplitude of Sound:** Intensity - perceived as sound loudness.
*   **Sound Intensity:** $I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$ (Units: $W/m^2$)
*   **Sound Intensity Level (Decibel Scale):**
    *   $\beta = 10 \log \left( \frac{I}{I_0} \right)$
    *   $I = 10^{\beta/10 - 12}$
    *   **Threshold of Hearing:** $\approx 10^{-12} \text{ W/m}^2$

## Doppler Effect
The apparent change in the frequency (hence pitch) of sound due to the relative motion of the sound source or the observer or both.

$$f_O = f_S \times \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s}$$

## Strings & Pipes
*   **Strings:** $v = \sqrt{\frac{FL}{m}}$; $f_n = n \times \frac{v}{2L}$
*   **Open-Close Pipe:** $f_n = n \times \frac{v}{4L}$ (where $n = 1, 3, 5, 7...$)
*   **Open-Open Pipe:** $f_n = n \times \frac{v}{2L}$ (where $n = 1, 2, 3, 4...$)

# ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND OPTICS

## EM Waves
Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves of oscillating magnetic and electrical waves perpendicular to one another.
*   The direction of EM-waves follows the Right Hand Rule (RHR).
*   They can be generated by an accelerated charge.
*   **Speed of EM waves** = Speed of light ($c$) $\approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$.

**Frequency-Wavelength Relation:**
$$c = \lambda f$$

## Geometric Optics
*   **Reflection:** Change in the direction of light when it strikes a highly polished surface.
*   **Law of Reflection:** $\theta_i = \theta_r$ (for plane mirrors).

### Spherical Mirrors
| Feature | Convex | Concave |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focal length** | $f = -R/2$ | $f = +R/2$ |
| **Mirror Equation** | $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$ | $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$ |
| **Magnification** | $m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} = \frac{h_i}{h_o}$ | $m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} = \frac{h_i}{h_o}$ |

**Conventions for Spherical Mirrors:**
*   If $d_i$ is (+), image is real (front of mirror).
*   If $d_i$ is (-), image is virtual (no image).
*   If $m$ is (+), image is upright/erect.
*   If $m$ is (-), image is inverted.
*   If $m > 1$, image is stretched/enlarged.
*   If $m < 1$, image is compressed.

## Refraction
Refraction is the change in the speed of light, hence its direction, when it passes through one material to another.

**Index of Refraction ($n$):**
$$n = \frac{\text{speed of light in vacuum}}{\text{speed of light in the material}} = \frac{c}{v}$$

**Snell’s Law:**
$$n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$$

**Total Internal Reflection:**
Occurs when the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle of incidence.
**Critical angle:** The angle at which the angle of refraction is 90°.
$$\sin \theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$$

### Lenses
Lenses are objects used to bend light by refraction.

| Feature | Convex/Converging | Concave/Diverging |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focal length** | $f = +R/2$ | $f = -R/2$ |
| **Thin-lens Eq.** | $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$ | $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$ |
| **Magnification** | $m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} = \frac{h_i}{h_o}$ | $m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} = \frac{h_i}{h_o}$ |

**Conventions for Thin Lenses:**
*   If $d_i$ is (+), image is real (right of the lens).
*   If $d_i$ is (-), image is virtual (left of the lens).
*   Similar rules for mirrors follow for $m$.

**Meniscus Lenses:**
*   **Optical Power of Lens:** $\text{Diopter} = \frac{1}{f \text{ (in meters)}}$
*   Lens Maker's Formula: $\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)$

## Dispersion
Dispersion is the spreading of white light into its full spectrum of wavelengths. Rainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection.
